# bartering.games

A Steam key bartering platform where gamers can trade game keys.
Domain: bartering.games

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.26 (Chi router, Connect-go for RPC, sqlc for queries, pgx for dynamic SQL)
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit (Svelte 5), TypeScript, pnpm
- **API Contract**: Protobuf + Buf + Connect (`.proto` files are the source of truth)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Atlas migrations (declarative HCL schema + versioned migrations), sqlc codegen
- **Deployment**: Kamal 2 on Hetzner VPS, Docker images, Traefik for SSL
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki (self-hosted), Sentry, UptimeRobot

## Build Output

- Go binaries go in `backend/bin/` (gitignored). Always use `go build -o bin/ ./cmd/...`
  when compiling manually. Never run `go build` without `-o bin/` — bare `go build`
  drops binaries in the source tree.

## Code Style & Conventions

- **Readability over cleverness**, unless the performance benefit is significant
- Never log plaintext game keys, vault passphrases, or sensitive user data

## Running Tasks

All project tasks use Taskfile (`task` CLI):
```bash
task hooks:install   # Install git pre-commit hooks (run once after cloning)
task lint            # Run all linters (Go + TS + Proto)
task test            # Run all unit tests
task test:go         # Go unit tests
task test:ts         # TypeScript unit tests (Vitest)
task test:int        # Integration tests (testcontainers, needs Docker)
task test:e2e        # Playwright browser tests
task generate        # Run all codegen (buf generate + sqlc generate)
task generate:proto  # buf generate only
task generate:sqlc   # sqlc generate only
task migrate         # Run Atlas migrations
task migrate:diff    # Generate migration from schema.hcl diff (usage: task migrate:diff -- <name>)
task dev             # Start local dev environment (docker-compose up + servers)
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run linters automatically on staged files before each commit.
Install once after cloning:

```bash
brew install lefthook golangci-lint gopls typescript-language-server  # prerequisites
task hooks:install
```

## Claude Code LSP Setup

LSP servers give Claude real-time diagnostics, go-to-definition, and type info while editing.

Active plugins (installed via `claude-plugins-official` marketplace):
- **Go**: `gopls-lsp` — requires `gopls` in PATH: `brew install gopls`
- **TypeScript**: `typescript-lsp` — requires `typescript-language-server` in PATH: `brew install typescript-language-server`

Note: `svelte-language-server` is a pnpm dev dep in `frontend/` for editor tooling (VS Code,
Neovim, etc.) — it is version-pinned so all devs get the same server after `pnpm install`.
`typescript-language-server` is installed via Homebrew (not a pnpm dep).
No Svelte LSP plugin exists for Claude Code yet.

Hooks run in parallel and only check staged files — Go, TS/Svelte, and Proto each
have their own linter triggered only when relevant files are staged.

**Claude must never run `git commit --no-verify` without explicit user instruction.**
If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the underlying issue. Only bypass hooks if the user
directly asks for it.

## Testing

- **Go unit tests**: `go test ./...` in `backend/`
- **Go integration tests**: `go test -tags=integration ./...` (uses testcontainers for real Postgres)
- **TS unit tests**: Vitest in `frontend/`
- **Browser E2E**: Playwright in `frontend/tests/e2e/` (multi-context for two-user trade flows)
- **CI** (GitHub Actions): lint + unit tests + integration tests. Browser E2E not in CI initially.

## Git Workflow

- When starting work on a Shortcut story, always branch off of `main`. Before creating
  the feature branch:
  1. `git fetch origin main`
  2. Check if local `main` is behind `origin/main`.
  3. If behind and already on `main`: just `git pull --ff-only origin main` (safe
     fast-forward, no confirmation needed).
  4. If behind and on a different branch, or if fast-forward isn't possible: offer the
     user options (e.g., switch to main and pull, create branch from `origin/main`
     directly, rebase, etc.).
  5. Create the feature branch from the up-to-date main.
- Use the branch name generated by Shortcut (via `stories-get-branch-name`) as the
  feature branch. Do not invent a branch name. The format is
  `{mention_name}/sc-{story_id}/{description}` e.g.
  `jackf/sc-48/set-up-sqlc-code-generation`.
- All feature work (commits, pushes) happens on the feature branch, never on `main`.
  Merge into `main` only via squash-merge PR.
- Shortcut stories auto-transition to "Done" when their linked PR is merged (via
  GitHub integration). No need to manually update story state after merge.

## Docker

- The backend runtime image uses `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` — no shell, no package manager, runs as UID 65532. For local debugging (`docker exec`), swap to `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:debug` which includes busybox.
- The frontend runtime image uses `node:22-alpine` running as the `node` user.
- Build both images locally with `task docker:build`.

## Architecture Patterns

- **Ports and Adapters**: Business logic in `service/` depends on interfaces in `port/`.
  Implementations in `adapter/` (steam, igdb, itad, manual). Tests use mock adapters.
- **Client-side encryption**: Game keys encrypted in browser via WebCrypto (AES-256-GCM).
  Server stores opaque blobs only. Trade auto-reveal via RSA-OAEP escrow.
- **Background workers**: Go goroutines for Steam library sync, wishlist sync, game
  enrichment, bundle data. Heartbeat table for monitoring.
- **Server-side sessions**: Hashed tokens in Postgres, HttpOnly cookies. No JWTs.
  Session lookup per request (~0.2ms). Instant revocation on logout/compromise.
- **Generated code checked into Git**: Both protobuf (backend/gen/, frontend/gen/) and
  sqlc (backend/internal/storage/db/) output is committed. CI verifies codegen is committed.
- **Housekeeping**: Remove `.gitkeep` placeholder files from directories once real
  content is added.
